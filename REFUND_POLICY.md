# Refund Policy — ReactedHQ

Refund window: **7 days** from purchase.

## Eligible refunds
We will refund if:
1) The kit fails to run on a supported Windows machine (PowerShell 5.1+) **and**
2) You email **deemmanymg@gmail.com** within 7 days with:
   - a screenshot or copy/paste of the error, and
   - the exact command you ran.

## Not eligible
- The tool runs, but it didn’t resolve your incident (this is a **triage/reporting** tool).

Refunds are issued to the original payment method.
